### What is that?
This is the API that will respond to this chrome [extension](https://github.com/YellowCoder/mark-it-chrome-extension). 

### Why does it exist?
I am an active english learner so every day I try to learn at least 5 new expressions. The method that I use is to visit some dictionary and looking for expressions and then I add new phrases to my [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).

This is great because I avoid repetition of these expressions. Once I added, I will never add again.
